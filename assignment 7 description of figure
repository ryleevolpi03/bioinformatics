This screenshot highlights a region on chromosome 3 in Nothobranchius whitei where various layers of genomic data intersect to reveal a compelling biological narrative. The blue peaks represent ATAC-seq signals, indicating areas of open chromatin that are accessible and potentially function as enhancers or other regulatory elements. The red peaks, derived from RNA-seq data, show active gene expression in this region â€” essentially marking which genes are being transcribed. The purple loops come from Hi-C data and depict physical interactions within the genome, showing segments that are spatially close in three-dimensional space. Notably, one loop links an open chromatin region (a non-coding OCR) with a site of active gene expression, suggesting that this distant non-coding region may be regulating that gene, likely functioning as an enhancer. Overall, this visualization offers a clear example of the intricate relationship between genome architecture and gene regulation.
